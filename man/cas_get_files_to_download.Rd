\usage{
cas_get_files_to_download(
  urls = NULL,
  index = FALSE,
  index_group = NULL,
  ignore_id = TRUE,
  desc_id = FALSE,
  batch = NULL,
  create_folder_if_missing = NULL,
  custom_folder = NULL,
  custom_path = NULL,
  file_format = "html",
  db_connection = NULL,
  download_again = FALSE,
  download_again_if_status_is_not = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{urls}{Defaults to NULL. If given, it should correspond with a data
frame with at least two columns named \code{id} and \code{url}. If not given, an
attempt will be made to load it from the local database.}

\item{index}{Logical, defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, downloaded files will be
considered \code{index} files. If not, they will be considered \code{contents} files.
See Readme for a more extensive explanation.}

\item{desc_id}{Logical, defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, results are returned with
highest id first.}

\item{batch}{An integer, defaults to NULL. If not given, a check is performed
in the database to find if previous downloads have taken place. If so, by
default, the current batch will be one unit higher than the highest batch
number found in the database.}

\item{file_format}{Defaults to \code{html}. Used for storing files in dedicated
folders, but also for determining processing options. For example, if a
sitemap is downloaded as an index with \code{file_format} set to xml, it will be
processed accordingly. If it is stored as xml.gz, it will be automatically
decompressed for correct processing.}

\item{download_again_if_status_is_not}{Defaults to NULL. If given, it must a
status code as integer, typically \code{200L}, or \code{c(200L, 404L)}.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[=cas_get_urls_df]{cas_get_urls_df}}, \code{\link[=cas_get_base_folder]{cas_get_base_folder}}

    \item{\code{custom_path}}{Defaults to NULL. If given, all other parameters and settings are ignored, and folder is set to this value.}

\value{
A data frame with four columns: \code{id}, \code{url}, \code{path} and \code{type}

\usage{
cas_write_corpus(
  corpus = NULL,
  arrange_by = NULL,
  to_lower = FALSE,
  drop_na = TRUE,
  date = date,
  text = text,
  tif_compliant = TRUE,
  file_format = "parquet",
  partition = NULL,
  token = "full_text",
  corpus_folder = "corpus",
  path = NULL,
  db_connection = NULL,
  db_folder = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{corpus}{Defaults to NULL. If NULL, retrieves corpus from the current
website with \code{cas_read_db_contents_data()}. If given, it is expected to be
a corresponding data frame.}

\item{arrange_by}{Defaults to NULL. If given, expected to be an unquoted
column name, such as \code{date} or \code{id}.}

\item{to_lower}{Defaults to FALSE. Whether to convert tokens to lowercase.
Passed to \code{tidytext} if token is not \code{full_text}.}

\item{drop_na}{Defaults to TRUE. If TRUE, items that have NA in their \code{text}
or \code{date} columns are dropped. This is often useful, as in many cases these
may have other issues and/or cause inconsistencies in further analyses.}

\item{date}{Unquoted date column, defaults to \code{date}.}

\item{text}{Unquoted text column, defaults to \code{text}. If \code{tif_compliant} is
set to TRUE, it will be renamed to "text" even if originally it had a
different name.}

\item{tif_compliant}{Defaults to TRUE. If TRUE, it ensures that the first
column is a character vector named "doc_id" and that the second column is a
character vector named "text". See \url{https://docs.ropensci.org/tif/} for
details}

\item{file_format}{Defaults to "parquet". Currently, other options are not
implemented.}

\item{partition}{Defaults to NULL. If NULL, the parquet file is not
partitioned. "year" is a common alternative: if set to "year", the parquet
file is partitioned by year. If a \code{year} column does not exist, it is
created based on the assumption that a \code{date} column exists and it is (or
can be coerced to) a vector of class \code{Date}.}

\item{token}{Defaults to "full_text", which does not tokenise the text
column. If different from \code{full_text}, it is passed to
\code{tidytext::unnest_tokens} (see its help for details). Accepted values
include "words", "sentences", and "paragraphs". See
\code{?tidytext::unnest_tokens()} for details.}

\item{path}{Defaults to NULL. If NULL, path is set to the
project/website/export/dataset/file_format folder.}

\item{db_connection}{Defaults to NULL. If NULL, uses local SQLite database.
If given, must be a connection object or a list with relevant connection
settings (see example).}

\item{...}{Passed to \code{cas_get_db_file()}.}

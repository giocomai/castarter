\arguments{
\item{index}{Logical, defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, downloaded files will be
considered \code{index} files. If not, they will be considered \code{contents} files.
See Readme for a more extensive explanation.}

\item{remote}{Defaults to TRUE. If TRUE, opens relevant url online. If FALSE,
it opens the locally stored file.}

\item{file_format}{Defaults to \code{html}. Used for storing files in dedicated
folders, but also for determining processing options. For example, if a
sitemap is downloaded as an index with \code{file_format} set to xml, it will be
processed accordingly. If it is stored as xml.gz, it will be automatically
decompressed for correct processing.}

\item{sample}{Defaults to 1. By default, it opens one random url.}

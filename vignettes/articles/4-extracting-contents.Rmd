```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  eval = FALSE
)
```


## Automatic extraction of contents and metadata

This is a bit of a shortcut, and may or may not work, but also, as it may make life easier for beginners, let's present this option. 

```{r setup european_parliament_paginated}
library("castarter")

cas_set_options(
  base_folder = fs::path(
    fs::path_home_r(),
    "R",
    "castarter_vignettes"
  ),
  project = "european_union",
  website = "european_parliament_paginated"
)
```


```{r install castarter.readability}
pak::pak("giocomai/castarter.readability")
```


```{r extract with readability}
cas_extract(extractors = NULL,
            readability = TRUE,
            write_to_db = FALSE,
            sample = 10)
```
